Silo uses Alloy for software modelling. Alloy models go in `.als` files in the `specs/` directory. Run verification commands of Alloy models with:

```shell
alloy6 exec -f -o specs/output specs/<some-spec>.als
```

Don't use `| head` or `| tail` commands when running alloy verifications -- they are slow and these piped commands make it hard to see if the command is working or not.
