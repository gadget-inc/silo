The silo repo uses nix, nix flakes and direnv to manage the development environment. If you are finding that commands are missing from your development environment, reload the shell with `direnv reload`.

Don't use `nix develop -c` to run commands as it doesnt pass signals down correctly -- assume direnv has properly setup your shell, and reload if it hasn't.

Use `direnv exec` to run one-off commands in new shells to activate the nix env, which should have all the development tooling necessary, like `protoc` or similar.
