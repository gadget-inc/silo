When running tests, assume the background services required are already running.

You can run rust tests with `cargo test`.

You can run TypeScript client tests with

```shell
cd typescript_client
pnpm test
```

You can run the TypeScript integration tests with:

```shell
cd typescript_client
RUN_INTEGRATION=true pnpm test
```

The TypeScript integration tests require a running Silo server. Assume one is running, but if you see that it can't be connected to, run your own in the background. Shut it down when you are done.

Use the #[silo::test] macro for wrapping rust test cases (not tokio::test).
