- [x] task dequeuing
- [x] task leases, heartbeats
- [x] attempt failure/success reporting
- [x] lease expiry
- [ ] deleting a job deletes the tasks for it (should this be a scan or another index?)
- [ ] performance improvement to add attempt view, task view, so we're not deserializing into structs
- [x] GRPC layer for invoking functions
- [ ] limits on payload, error, result size
- [ ] cancel api
- [ ] get job info api
- [ ] list jobs api
- [ ] clustering
  - [ ] raft cluster membership for atomic changes
  - [ ] initial peer discovery via config files or headless DNS service or something like that
  - [ ] get the shard count from the config
  - [ ] make it easy to pass a unique node id down (use hostname:listenport as default if not set?)
  - [ ] minimize error logging when follower is offline https://docs.rs/openraft/latest/openraft/docs/faq/index.html#how-to-minimize-error-logging-when-a-follower-is-offline
  - [ ] add tests for graceful node shutdown
  - [ ] run openraft tests that ensure our implementations pass their conformance suites https://docs.rs/openraft/latest/openraft/docs/getting_started/index.html#ensure-the-storage-implementation-is-correct
- [ ] webui / operator tooling
- [ ] /healthz endpoint
- [ ] /metrics prometheus endpoint
- [ ] opentelemetry support
- [ ] investigate how we might do schema evolution
- [ ] secondary indexes for filtering
- [ ] once transaction support, make enqueue idempotency not a read-then-write but some sort of conditional write
