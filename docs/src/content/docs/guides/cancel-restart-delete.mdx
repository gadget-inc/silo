title: Cancel, Restart, Delete
---

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Jobs in Silo can be cancelled to stop processing, restarted to retry after failure, deleted to permanently remove them from the system, or expedited to run immediately if they were scheduled for the future. 

## Cancelling Jobs

Cancellation requests that a job stop processing. The behavior depends on the job's current state:

- **Scheduled jobs**: The job is immediately marked as Cancelled and will never run
- **Running jobs**: A cancellation flag is set and the worker discovers this on its next heartbeat. The worker's task then should stop processing and report a cancelled outcome, but the specific JS task handler can take arbitrarily long to do this as long as it continues to hold the lease.

### Using the Client

You can cancel a job directly using the client:

```typescript
import { SiloGRPCClient, JobNotFoundError } from "@silo-ai/client";

const client = new SiloGRPCClient({
  servers: ["localhost:7450"],
});

// Cancel a job by ID
try {
  await client.cancelJob("job-123");
  console.log("Job cancelled");
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof JobNotFoundError) {
    console.log("Job not found");
  }
  throw error;
}
```

If you're using tenancy, include the tenant:

```typescript
await client.cancelJob("job-123", "customer-456");
```

### Using Job Handles

Job handles provide a convenient `cancel()` method:

```typescript
// From enqueue
const handle = await client.enqueue({
  payload: { task: "process-data" }
});

// Cancel anytime later
await handle.cancel();
```

Or create a handle for an existing job:

```typescript
// Create a handle from a known job ID
const handle = client.handle("job-123");
await handle.cancel();

// Or with a tenant
const handle = client.handle("job-456", "customer-123");
await handle.cancel();
```

### Cancellation Errors

The `cancelJob()` method can throw several errors:

| Error | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| `JobNotFoundError` | The job ID does not exist |
| `RpcError` (FAILED_PRECONDITION) | The job is already cancelled |
| `RpcError` (FAILED_PRECONDITION) | The job is already in a terminal state (Succeeded or Failed) |

<Aside type="tip" title="Cancellation is monotonic">
Once a job is cancelled, it stays cancelled. Attempting to cancel an already-cancelled job returns an error, but you can use [`restart()`](#restarting-jobs) to allow the job to run again.
</Aside>

### How Workers Discover Cancellation

The `SiloWorker` handles heartbeats automatically. When a job is cancelled, the worker detects it on the next heartbeat and aborts the `cancellationSignal` passed to your handler. Your handler should check this signal and stop work:

```typescript
const worker = new SiloWorker({
  client,
  workerId: "worker-1",
  taskGroup: "data-processing",
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    for (const item of ctx.task.payload.items) {
      // Check for cancellation between units of work
      if (ctx.cancellationSignal.aborted) {
        return { type: "cancelled" };
      }
      await processItem(item);
    }
    return { type: "success", result: { processed: true } };
  }
});
```

You can also pass the signal to APIs that accept `AbortSignal`:

```typescript
handler: async (ctx) => {
  const response = await fetch(ctx.task.payload.url, {
    signal: ctx.cancellationSignal
  });
  // ...
}
```

<Aside type="caution" title="Workers must cooperate">
Cancellation in Silo is cooperative. The worker notifies your handler via the cancellation signal, but the handler must check the signal and stop its own work. Configure `heartbeatIntervalMs` on the worker (default 5 seconds) to control how quickly cancellations are detected.
</Aside>

## Deleting Jobs

Deletion permanently removes a job and all its data from Silo. Unlike cancellation, deletion completely erases the job from storage.

### Using the Client

```typescript
// Delete a job by ID
await client.deleteJob("job-123");

// With tenant
await client.deleteJob("job-456", "customer-123");
```

### Using Job Handles

```typescript
const handle = client.handle("job-123");
await handle.delete();
```

### Deletion Requirements

<Aside type="caution" title="Jobs must be in a terminal state">
You can only delete jobs that have finished processing. Jobs must be in one of these states:
- **Succeeded** — completed successfully
- **Failed** — failed after exhausting retries
- **Cancelled** — was cancelled

Attempting to delete a Scheduled or Running job will throw an error.
</Aside>

### Deletion Errors

| Error | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| `JobNotFoundError` | The job ID does not exist |
| `RpcError` (INTERNAL) | The job is still in progress (Scheduled or Running) |

To delete a running job, first cancel it, then delete:

```typescript
const handle = client.handle("job-123");

// First cancel the job
await handle.cancel();

// Wait for cancellation to complete if needed
// (Running jobs need time for the worker to acknowledge)
const status = await handle.getStatus();
if (status === JobStatus.Cancelled) {
  await handle.delete();
}
```

## Restarting Jobs

Restarting allows you to re-run a job that has stopped—either because it was cancelled or because it failed after exhausting its retries. The job is re-queued with a fresh retry counter, giving it another set of chances to successfully complete.

### When to Restart

Restart is useful in several scenarios:

- **Accidental cancellation**: A job was cancelled by mistake and needs to run
- **Transient failures**: A job failed due to temporary issues (service outage, rate limits) that have been resolved, and an operator wants to manually gie it more retries
- **Manual retry**: You want to give a failed job another attempt outside of its automatic retry policy because you really want it to succeed

### Using the Client

You can restart a job directly using the client:

```typescript
import { SiloGRPCClient, JobNotFoundError } from "@silo-ai/client";

const client = new SiloGRPCClient({
  servers: ["localhost:7450"],
});

// Restart a job by ID
await client.restartJob("job-123");
console.log("Job restarted and re-queued");
```

If you're using tenancy, include the tenant:

```typescript
await client.restartJob("job-123", "customer-456");
```

### Using Job Handles

Job handles provide a convenient `restart()` method:

```typescript
// Create a handle for an existing job
const handle = client.handle("job-123");
await handle.restart();

// Or with a tenant
const handle = client.handle("job-456", "customer-123");
await handle.restart();
```

### What Restart Does

When you restart a job, Silo:

1. **Clears the cancellation flag** (if the job was cancelled)
2. **Creates a new task** with `attempt_number = 1`, resetting the retry counter
3. **Sets the status to Scheduled**, placing the job back in the queue for immediate processing
4. **Preserves the original job data** including payload, priority, limits, and metadata

The job will be picked up by the next available worker and processed as if it were newly enqueued.

<Aside type="tip" title="Fresh retry counter">
Restarting always resets the attempt counter to 1. If the job has a retry policy, it gets a full set of fresh retries. This is intentional—restart is a manual intervention that signals you want to give the job a complete new chance.
</Aside>

### Restart Requirements

Only jobs in terminal-but-recoverable states can be restarted:

| Status | Can Restart? | Reason |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| **Cancelled** | ✅ Yes | Job was stopped before completion |
| **Failed** | ✅ Yes | Job failed but can be retried |
| **Succeeded** | ❌ No | Job completed successfully—nothing to retry |
| **Scheduled** | ❌ No | Job is already queued to run |
| **Running** | ❌ No | Job is currently being processed |

<Aside type="caution" title="Succeeded jobs cannot be restarted">
Once a job succeeds, it's truly terminal. If you need to run the same work again, enqueue a new job. This prevents accidental re-processing of completed work.
</Aside>

### Restart Errors

The `restartJob()` method can throw several errors:

| Error | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| `JobNotFoundError` | The job ID does not exist |
| `RpcError` (FAILED_PRECONDITION) | Job already succeeded (truly terminal) |
| `RpcError` (FAILED_PRECONDITION) | Job is still in progress (Scheduled or Running) |

```typescript
import { RpcError } from "@protobuf-ts/runtime-rpc";

try {
  await handle.restart();
  console.log("Job restarted successfully");
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof RpcError && error.code === "FAILED_PRECONDITION") {
    // Check the message to understand why
    console.log("Cannot restart job:", error.message);
    // e.g., "job already succeeded" or "job is still in progress"
  }
  throw error;
}
```

### Restarting Failed Jobs

A common pattern is to monitor for failed jobs and restart them after fixing the underlying issue:

```typescript
import { JobStatus } from "@silo-ai/client";

// Check if a job failed
const handle = client.handle("job-123", "customer-456");
const status = await handle.getStatus();

if (status === JobStatus.Failed) {
  // Get job details to understand the failure
  const job = await handle.getJob();
  console.log(`Job failed at ${job.statusChangedAtMs}`);
  
  // After fixing the issue, restart the job
  await handle.restart();
  console.log("Job restarted");
}
```

### Restarting Cancelled Jobs

If a job was cancelled by mistake, you can restart it to allow processing:

```typescript
import { JobStatus } from "@silo-ai/client";

const handle = client.handle("job-123");
const status = await handle.getStatus();

if (status === JobStatus.Cancelled) {
  // Restart the cancelled job
  await handle.restart();
  console.log("Cancelled job has been restarted");
}
```

## Expediting Jobs

Expediting allows you to make a future-scheduled job or attempt run immediately, skipping any scheduled delay. This is useful for dragging forward jobs that were scheduled for later or for bypassing retry backoff delays.

### When to Expedite

Expedite is useful in several scenarios:

- **User-initiated urgency**: A user requests immediate processing of a scheduled job
- **Skip retry delays**: A job is waiting for retry backoff, but you've fixed the issue and want it to run now
- **Testing scheduled jobs**: You want to test a future-scheduled job without waiting
- **Priority escalation**: Business needs change and a scheduled job needs to run immediately

### Using the Client

You can expedite a job directly using the client:

```typescript
import { SiloGRPCClient, JobNotFoundError } from "@silo-ai/client";

const client = new SiloGRPCClient({
  servers: ["localhost:7450"],
});

// Expedite a job by ID
try {
  await client.expediteJob("job-123");
  console.log("Job expedited and ready to run immediately");
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof JobNotFoundError) {
    console.log("Job not found");
  }
  throw error;
}
```

If you're using tenancy, include the tenant:

```typescript
await client.expediteJob("job-123", "customer-456");
```

### Using Job Handles

Job handles provide a convenient `expedite()` method:

```typescript
// Create a handle for an existing job
const handle = client.handle("job-123");
await handle.expedite();

// Or with a tenant
const handle = client.handle("job-456", "customer-123");
await handle.expedite();
```

### What Expedite Does

When you expedite a job, Silo:

1. **Finds the future-scheduled task** in the task queue
2. **Updates the task timestamp** to the current time, making it immediately ready
3. **Wakes up the task broker** to pick up the newly available task
4. **Preserves all other job data** including attempt number, priority, limits, and metadata

The job becomes immediately available for workers to lease and process.

<Aside type="tip" title="Expedite vs Restart">
Expedite is different from restart:
- **Expedite** moves a future-scheduled attempt forward in time (keeps the same attempt number)
- **Restart** creates a brand new attempt with a fresh retry counter (resets to attempt 1)

Use expedite when you want to skip waiting time. Use restart when you want fresh retries.
</Aside>

### Expedite Requirements

Only jobs with future-scheduled tasks can be expedited:

| Condition | Can Expedite? | Reason |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| **Future-scheduled task** | ✅ Yes | Task timestamp is in the future |
| **Mid-retry with backoff** | ✅ Yes | Retry is scheduled for future due to exponential backoff |
| **Ready to run now** | ❌ No | Task is already at current time or earlier |
| **Running** | ❌ No | Job is currently being processed |
| **Terminal (Succeeded/Failed)** | ❌ No | Job has finished processing |
| **Cancelled** | ❌ No | Job was cancelled |
| **No pending task** | ❌ No | Job has no task in the queue |

<Aside type="caution" title="Task must be in the future">
Expedite only works if the task's scheduled time is genuinely in the future. If a job is already ready to run (timestamp ≤ now), expediting it has no effect and will return an error. This prevents accidentally expediting jobs that are already being processed by the task broker.
</Aside>

### Expedite Errors

The `expediteJob()` method can throw several errors:

| Error | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| `JobNotFoundError` | The job ID does not exist |
| `RpcError` (FAILED_PRECONDITION) | Job is currently running |
| `RpcError` (FAILED_PRECONDITION) | Job is terminal (Succeeded or Failed) |
| `RpcError` (FAILED_PRECONDITION) | Job is cancelled |
| `RpcError` (FAILED_PRECONDITION) | Task is already ready to run (not future-scheduled) |
| `RpcError` (FAILED_PRECONDITION) | Job has no pending task in queue |

```typescript
import { RpcError } from "@protobuf-ts/runtime-rpc";

try {
  await handle.expedite();
  console.log("Job expedited successfully");
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof RpcError && error.code === "FAILED_PRECONDITION") {
    // Check the message to understand why
    console.log("Cannot expedite job:", error.message);
    // e.g., "job is already running" or "task is already ready to run"
  }
  throw error;
}
```

### Expediting Scheduled Jobs

The most common use case is expediting jobs that were enqueued with a future `startAtMs`:

```typescript
import { JobStatus } from "@silo-ai/client";

// Enqueue a job to run 1 hour from now
const handle = await client.enqueue({
  payload: { task: "process-data" },
  startAtMs: BigInt(Date.now() + 3_600_000), // 1 hour
});

// Check that it's scheduled
const status = await handle.getStatus();
console.log(status); // JobStatus.Scheduled

// Business needs changed - run it now!
await handle.expedite();

// Job is now immediately available for workers
```

### Expediting Mid-Retry Jobs

When a job is retrying with exponential backoff, you can skip the waiting period:

```typescript
import { JobStatus } from "@silo-ai/client";

// A job failed and is scheduled to retry in 5 minutes
const handle = client.handle("failed-job-123");
const status = await handle.getStatus();

if (status === JobStatus.Scheduled) {
  // You fixed the underlying issue and want to retry immediately
  await handle.expedite();
  console.log("Retry backoff skipped - job will run now");
}
```

### Expediting vs Higher Priority

If you want a job to run sooner but it's not necessarily urgent, consider using priority instead of expediting:

```typescript
// During enqueue, use higher priority
const handle = await client.enqueue({
  payload: { task: "process-data" },
  taskGroup: "data-processing",
  priority: 0, // 0 is highest priority, processed sooner
});

// Expedite is for jobs that must run NOW
// Priority is for jobs that should run SOONER
```

Expedite is an immediate operation that bypasses time entirely. Priority adjusts ordering among ready jobs. Priority can't be changed once a job has been enqueued.
