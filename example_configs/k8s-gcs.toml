# Example config for Kubernetes deployment with Google Cloud Storage
# Uses K8s Lease-based coordination and GCS for object storage
# WAL is stored locally for low-latency writes, main data in GCS
#
# Environment Variable Substitution:
# Silo supports ${VAR} and ${VAR:-default} syntax in config values.
# This is useful for injecting Kubernetes Downward API values.

[server]
# Bind to all interfaces on port 50051
grpc_addr = "0.0.0.0:50051"

[coordination]
backend = "k8s"
cluster_prefix = "silo-prod"
lease_ttl_secs = 15

# IMPORTANT: advertised_grpc_addr is the address other nodes use to connect.
# In Kubernetes, use the pod IP (exposed via Downward API).
# If not set, defaults to grpc_addr which won't work if you bind to 0.0.0.0.
#
# Expose POD_IP in your deployment using the Downward API:
#   env:
#     - name: POD_IP
#       valueFrom:
#         fieldRef:
#           fieldPath: status.podIP
#
advertised_grpc_addr = "${POD_IP}:50051"

[database]
# Use URL backend for GCS - SlateDB resolves gs:// URLs automatically
# Credentials are read from GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS or workload identity

# Optional: Use local filesystem for WAL for lower write latency
# If omitted, WAL uses the same backend as the main store
